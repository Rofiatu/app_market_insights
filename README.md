# app_market_insights
A trend analysis of the Android and Apple market for insights on future app development

In this project, we aim to assess revenue drivers, by analysing the level of user engagament and interaction with mobile applications, as a measure of profitability. We use metrics from Google Play Store and Apple Store, as reference.

The goal of this analysis is to analyze data in order to help our developers understand what type of apps are likely to attract more users, and make recommendations based on our findings.

The core questions this analysis aims to find answers to, include:

- Engagement: Which app categories show the highest user engagement based on installs and reviews?

- Opportunity: Which categories are relatively unsaturated yet show high user engagement?

- Demographics: Who are the primary users of these app categories (age, location, preferences) assessed by which content rating has the most engagement?
